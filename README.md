# SkillsHarmonix

## Description

SkillsHarmonix aims to address the problem of unemployment and underemployment in a specific region. It provides a platform for local businesses to post job listings and for job seekers to find local employment opportunities easily.

The primary objective of the project is to establish a connection or bridge between businesses operating within the chosen locale and individuals who are actively seeking employment opportunities in that same area. The platform serves as a matchmaking service, ensuring that job listings from local businesses reach the local workforce.

The project's effectiveness and impact are directly linked to the presence and active participation of two key groups: local businesses and local job seekers. The more businesses that post job listings and job seekers who use the platform, the more successful the project will be. It relies on a critical mass of both job listings and users to create a vibrant and effective local job market.

The project's secondary objective is to provide a platform for local businesses to find and hire local talent. The platform will allow businesses to post job listings and receive applications from local job seekers. Businesses will be able to view the profiles of job seekers who have applied for their job listings and contact them directly. Businesses will also be able to accept or reject applications for their job listings.
